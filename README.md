# Connect-4

This is an Java program from my APCS class, in which we had to create an program that would replicate the popular game Connect-4 using a Java graphics library. Connect4 is a popular two-player game in which one of the players has to connect four of their colored pieces by dropping them into the columns of the holder before their opponent does.

This is what the Program looks upon launch.

The game's pieces are placed using the click of the cursor into the bottom of the columns and can stack on top of other pieces if there is already a piece on the bottom.

Upon every move, the game logic checks if any of the win conditions have been met, which can four pieces in row, column, or diagonal.
The game will continue to allow you to place pieces until either one of the players has met any of the win conditions.
